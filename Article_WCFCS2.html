						<h2><a href="#">WynnCraft FightClub Season 2 Recap</a></h2>

						<img src="images/unknown.png" width="775" height="500" alt="" />

						<p style="text-align:left">
							Season 2 started out well with the banning of Combat Warp, forcing many players to explore a new meta. The so-called “Walmart Combat Warp” began emerging as a viable build replacing Warp with the slightly less-effective Fatal.
							<br /><br />
							For 13 weeks, SpamLMB was undefeated as the previous WCFC Champion, and with his trademark Fatal build, it seemed like there was going to be a repeat of Season 1.
							<br /><br />
							With Combat Warp out of the way, and heal potions banned, mage became the dominant PVP class one way or another.
							<br /><br />
							Many other competitors stood their ground, however, against the growing meta. Namely, DogeTennant and IAmARatYes, who stuck with their Shaman and Assassin builds respectively until the very end, showing a masterful skill of PVP to compete with the far more overpowered mages.
							<br /><br />
							Amidst the season, some controversy did arise, however. Biblonko and Ugastag Da Llamma, WCFC Gladiators since day 1 of season 2, were caught precharging their courage powder abilities prior to fights.
							<br /><br />
							In their defense, they were unaware of their wrongdoing, and thus were not punished severely. All fights involving those powder abilities were rematched to maintain fairness.
							<br /><br /><br />
							Enter: Triflame.
							<br /><br /><br />
							One of the top PVPers on the WynnCraft hunting scene, Triflame had a rocky start to WCFC, going 0-4 in his first few matches. However, once he determined the meta, he captilized on it FAST, rising from the bottom of the leaderboards to 6th place in just a few weeks.
							<br />
							Also worth mentioning is Leafish, who’s performance, although not deviating from the meta, showed a mastery of PVP skill with Walmart Combat Warp, as he was one of the only people to ever defeat SpamLMB in a Season 2 match.
							<br />
							<strong>Your top 10 Qualifying competitors in Season 2 are as follows:</strong><br />
							1. SpamLMB<br />
							2. JerryStuffRo<br />
							3. Leafish<br />
							4. Rabaluda<br />
							5. BadNewsBears<br />
							6.  Tripflame<br />
							7. MrTopper<br />
							8. Ugastag<br />
							9. DogeTennant<br />
							10. Biblonko<br />
						</p>
						<img src="images/known.png"alt="" />
						<p style="text-align:left">
							In the first elimination round of finals, MrTopper and Rabaluda were eliminated.
							<br /><br />
							Following Eliminations, the quarterfinals came down to Triflame (6), SpamLMB (1), Leafish (3), and JerryStuffRo (2)
							<br /><br />
							In a walloping defeat, JerryStuffRo, rank #2 was knocked out by the #6 seed, Triflame, who up until this point, had been fighting with only Bear Mask.
							<br /><br />
							In perhaps the most massive upset in history, Leafish defeated SpamLMB in the Morph-Off rounds of their Best-of-Three match.
							<br /><br />
							In the final match, it was first to three wins. Triflame won the first 2 rounds, in a resounding victory. But out of nowhere, Leafish won the following 2 rounds, and tying the last. With nothing else to do, the referees declared a Morph-Off, which once again landed in a tie.
							<br /><br />
							In a final decision, the Referees chose for the competitors to Morph-Off in non-mage classes of their choosing. Triflame, opting to run an archer, finally defeated the resilient Leafish after 7 consecutive fights spanning 20min total.
							<br /><br />
							In the end, Triflame emerged victorious, and the legend of the Bear Mask lives on… but that is a story for another time.
