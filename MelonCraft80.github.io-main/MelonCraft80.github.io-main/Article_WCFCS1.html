							<strong>Over the course of 15 weeks, WCFC Season 1 has it’s winner: SPAMLMB!!! </strong><br />

							Season 1 began with some action-packed fights between Melon and LuCoolUs, facing off combat warp on combat warp. Many competitors have risent and fallen and rules have changed much since the beginning of WCFC.
							<br /><br />
							I am happy to announce that in Season 2 of WCFC, Warp will be BANNED!!!
							<br /><br />
							<strong>Your top 10 Qualifying competitors in Season 1 are as follows:</strong>
							<br />
							1.  Tealycraft    -    Rank: Emerald<br />
							2.  _Beanb    -    Rank: Emerald<br />
							3.  SpamLMB    -    Rank: Emerald<br />
							4.  3ndCraft    -    Rank: Emerald<br />
							5.  Klaetius    -    Rank: Silver<br />
							6.  iamaratyes    -    Rank: Silver<br />
							7.  TrialExpired    -    Rank: Bronze<br />
							8.  thedumox    -    Rank: Bronze<br />
							9.  DeathsAbyss    -    Rank: Bronze<br />
							10.  NagisaStreams    -    Rank: Bronze<br />
							<br />
							The season ended with a massive clash in the finals. Klaetius, TrialExpired, the dumox, DeathsAbyss, and NagisaStreams were all eliminated in the quarterfinal rounds.
							<br /><br />
							IAmARatYes, running his trademark Nullification EleDef build. However, he was quickly overpowered by _Beanb’s Raw Spell Damage with that highly powerful Idol.
							<br /><br />
							Tealycraft, as #1 seed in qualifiers was favored to win a match against SpamLMB’s Combat Warp, but in an incredible upset, Tealy lost the match to the up and coming #3 seed.
							<br /><br />
							In the final round, _Beanb was once again favored to win, as her Idol build had bested SpamLMB’s combat warp on 3 separate prior occasions.
							<br /><br />
							But in a final effort to defeat her, Spam made use of tactical flight and avoidance with his combat warp, favoring a hit-and-run playstyle, usually ineffective in PVP, but strangely very-effective against _Beanb’s Idol. She couldn’t keep up, and couldn’t tank the damage.
							<br /><br />
							In the last moments of the fight, SpamLMB emerged victorious and was crowned the Season 1 WCFC Champion.
							<br /><br /><br />
							What happened to the other semifinalists? _Beanb was never seen in a WCFC again for unknown reasons. Tealy left competition to focus on his Ambrosia business and become a GM for WynnCraft. After a mostly-successful seaso, IAmARatYes now serves as a Referee on the WCFC Staff team.
							<br />
							Unfortunately, footage from the WCFC Season 1 final was lost to time, and no longer exists.
